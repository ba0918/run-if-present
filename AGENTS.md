# Agent Instructions

## Core

- Serve the stated goal; do not widen the requested scope.
- Distinguish what is confirmed from what is inferred and what is unverified.
- After changing something, verify it by a means appropriate to the change.
- Do not perform irreversible, destructive, or externally visible actions without approval.
- Apply the project's own instructions where they are more specific than these.

conventions that apply only here — lives in `PROJECT.md`. Read it before making changes.
